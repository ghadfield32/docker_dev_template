Below is a quick summary, followed by detailed steps to resolve the “Found invalid RAILWAY\_TOKEN” error and successfully authenticate your Railway CLI.

Railway CLI supports two kinds of tokens: **project tokens** (set via `RAILWAY_TOKEN`) and **account/team tokens** (set via `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`) ([docs.railway.com][1]). If both are present, the CLI always prefers `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, so setting an account token in that variable will cause “invalid token” errors ([docs.railway.com][1]). You’ll need to **unset** any `RAILWAY_TOKEN` and only export your account token in `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` to run commands like `railway whoami` ([github.com][2]).

## Understanding Railway Token Types

Railway’s CLI distinguishes sharply between project-scoped and account-scoped tokens.

* **Project Tokens** (via `RAILWAY_TOKEN`) grant only project-level actions (e.g., `railway up`, `railway logs`) ([docs.railway.com][1]).
* **Account/Team Tokens** (via `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`) allow account-wide operations (e.g., `railway whoami`, `railway init`) ([docs.railway.com][1]).
* When both are set, `RAILWAY_TOKEN` takes precedence, so an invalid or mis-scoped project token will block even account-level commands ([docs.railway.com][1]).

## Why You’re Seeing “Invalid RAILWAY\_TOKEN”

You set your account token into both `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` **and** `RAILWAY_TOKEN`. Because the CLI sees `RAILWAY_TOKEN` first and treats it as a project token, it rejects it (“Unauthorized”) when you run `railway login` or `railway whoami` ([station.railway.com][3]).

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Unset the invalid project token**
   Remove `RAILWAY_TOKEN` from your session so the CLI can fall back to `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` only:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item Env:\RAILWAY_TOKEN
   ```

   ([docs.railway.com][1])

2. **Export only your account token**
   Set `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` in PowerShell for the current session:

   ```powershell
   $env:RAILWAY_API_TOKEN = "API_KEY"
   ```

   ([docs.railway.com][1])

3. *(Optional)* **Persist the token across sessions**
   To make it permanent in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   setx RAILWAY_API_TOKEN "API_KEY"
   ```

   ([docs.railway.com][4])

4. **(Re)login or verify**
   Now run:

   ```bash
   railway whoami
   ```

   It should print your Railway account identity instead of “Unauthorized” ([docs.railway.com][1]).

5. **Headless environments**
   If you need to authenticate without a browser (SSH/CI), you can pair manually:

   ```bash
   railway login --browserless
   ```

   ([fig.io][5])

## Verifying and Linking Your Project

* After you’ve authenticated, **associate** your local directory with a Railway project:

  ```bash
  railway link
  ```

  ([stackoverflow.com][6])

* Once linked, you’ll be able to run project commands:

  ```bash
  railway status
  railway up
  railway logs
  ```

  ([stackoverflow.com][6])

By ensuring only the correct environment variable is set and then linking your project, your Railway CLI commands should work without the “invalid token” error.
